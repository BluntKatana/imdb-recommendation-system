# Movie Recommendation System using Spark and IMDb Dataset

## Objective

Build a simple movie recommendation system using Apache Spark and IMDb datasets. This project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences.

## Tasks

### Data Preparation

- [ ] **Understand the Data**: Familiarize yourself with the IMDb datasets, including movie titles, genres, ratings, and user reviews.
- [ ] **Preprocess the Data**: Clean and preprocess the IMDb datasets using Spark DataFrame APIs. Handle missing values, filter out irrelevant information, and ensure data consistency.

### Model Development

- [ ] **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the IMDb datasets for recommendation purposes, such as movie genres, ratings, and user IDs.
- [ ] **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**: Divide the IMDb datasets into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- [ ] **Choose a Recommendation Algorithm**: Select a collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., ALS, SVD) from Spark's MLlib library for building the recommendation model.
- [ ] **Train the Recommendation Model**: Train the recommendation model using the training data. Configure model parameters based on dataset size and computational resources.
- [ ] **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the performance of the recommendation model using testing data. Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or precision and recall for evaluation.

### Recommendation Generation

- [ ] **Generate Recommendations**: Utilize the trained model to generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences. Implement APIs to predict ratings for user-item pairs and recommend top-rated movies.

### User Interface

- [ ] **Build a Simple UI**: Develop a basic user interface where users can input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations. Use web development frameworks like Flask or Django for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

### Deployment and Testing

- [ ] **Deploy and Test**: Deploy the recommendation system and UI to a local server or cloud platform. Test the system thoroughly to ensure accurate recommendations based on user preferences.

## Additional Notes

- Experiment with different algorithms and techniques to enhance the recommendation system further.
- Consider incorporating user feedback and refining the recommendation model based on user interactions.
- Document the development process, including any challenges faced and solutions implemented, for future reference.
